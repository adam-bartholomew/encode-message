Single-database configuration for Flask.

Unfortunately I didn't start using flask_migrate until I had been using models and making adjustments to them and the database by hand. Therefore, I included the Postgres SQL statements that create the needed tables (users, saved_messages) in ../db/
From this point on I will use flask_migrate when adding or modifying models.
